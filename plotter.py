# STAT 287: DATA SCIENCE I
# Unspecified HW Assignment from FALL 2021

description="""This plotter script reads time series values for the number of tweets
per hour.  Time series are read from the file {}.

Each line of the file consists of three integers separated by spaces. The first
integer represents the number of hours since the earliest observed tweet in all
the data (i.e., tweets occurring in that first hour will have a time of 0).
The second number represents the number of tweets occurring in that hour in the
Obama corpus.  The third number represents the number of tweets occurring in
that hour in the Romney corpus.

For example:
    0 9 2
    1 8 0
    2 5 11
    3 28 88
    . . .
    72 0 0
    73 1 0
    . . .
means there are 9 tweets in the Obama corpus in hour zero and two in Romney
corpus, and so forth. 

Note the following:

  * The number of hours continues well beyond 24, as the data cover multiple
    days.
  * Lines must be recorded in order by number of hours, so that the time
    series is correctly represented chronologically.
  * Zero counts need to be included for times when there are no counts, to
    "line" up the two time series.

Consult the course introductory reading if you need help preparing Python code
to write this file.
