# Twitter Sentiment AnalysisðŸ“±ðŸ“ˆ

## What? ðŸ’»
This repository includes a sentiment analysis on Tweets about 2012 Presidential Election.  The code was for a Homework assignemnt in STAT 287: Data Science I at the University of Vermont during the Fall 2021 semester. The TwitterData file as well as the plotter.py file were created/provided by Professor James Bagrow. The code to analyze the data, fix the messy data, and calculate the sentiment scores are my own. This is in the TwitterSentimentAnalysis.py file.

## Why?ðŸ¤”
I was seeking to answer how Twitter users felt (according to their word choice in their Tweets) about the candidates Mitt Romney and Barrack Obama. Additionally, as mentioned, this was part of the curriculum for my Data Science I course at UVM.
